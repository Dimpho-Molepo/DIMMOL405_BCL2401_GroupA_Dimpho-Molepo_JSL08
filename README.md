# Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## Project Overview

In this project, we write code that uses a singleton pattern to define a class. A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information. Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to a local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_8_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL08
2. Open the cloned project in a code editor.
3. Code a solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit changes to a local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push a local Git repository to a GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Learning Outcome

+ **Understanding the Singleton Pattern:** We gained a deep understanding of the Singleton pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful in managing unique resources or operations, such as the bank's branch information in this project.

+ **Applying the Singleton Pattern:** Beyond understanding the Singleton pattern, we learned how to apply it in a practical context. This involves writing code that uses the Singleton pattern to define a class.

+ **Improving Code Structure and Maintainability:** Through the use of design patterns like Singleton, we learned how to improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects. This will result in cleaner, more efficient code.

+ **Tackling Complex Design Challenges:** The project equipped us with the skills to tackle complex design challenges in our projects. This is achieved by understanding and applying design patterns, which provide solutions to common design problems.
